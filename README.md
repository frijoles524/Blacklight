# Blacklight
Version 2 of my old package manager. It is now a module and can be use programatically. Keep in mind it will manipulate the current interpreter and may hang it altogether, I recommend running a separate process for now. Main.py is an example script that uses blacklight to install and run an app that is defined in lists/me.json and does a get request to example.com. Venv_handler handles most of the runtime part of this, it can install dependencies and activate venvs (not traditional ones, it's a custom implementation). This is the first release so there might be missing features or bugs.
