# Blacklight
Version 2 of my old package manager. It is now a module and can be used programatically. Keep in mind it will manipulate the current interpreter and will hang it when running apps, I recommend running a subprocess for now. main.py is an example script that uses blacklight to install and run an app that is defined in lists/raven.json. venv_handler handles installing requirements and activating virtual envs (custom implementation).
